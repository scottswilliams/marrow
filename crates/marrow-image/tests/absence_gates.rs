//! Exact-symbol absence gates over `marrow-image/src`: shapes this crate has

//!
//! Each scan runs over the literal-stripped projection of the source, so a shape
//! spelled inside a comment or a string is not mistaken for the real thing. That
//! projection has exactly one owner in the workspace and is included here rather
//! than copied.
